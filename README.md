# Fiat-MC

Fiat-MC is a Minecraft server plugin that enables players to buy or sell items
with other players on the server. Players can optionally create a currency
that can be used to buy that player's goods and services. The currency can
either be backed by a physical commodity, or it can be a fiat currency.

NOTE: This is a WIP

# Run

To run, just download the FiatMcPlugin.jar and place in your plugins folder of
your Bukkit-enabled Minecraft server (Spigot, PaperMC, etc.).


# Build and Install

To build, you need a CraftBukkit jar so Fiat-MC can compile against the Bukkit
API. Download here: https://getbukkit.org/download/craftbukkit

Then, place it in the api/ folder. The build script currently expects
craftbukkit-1.15.2.jar.

Finally, run the build script:

    ./build.sh
